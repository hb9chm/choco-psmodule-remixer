## Contributing

To setup a development environment, first check that you have dependencies of PowerShell 5+ and choco installed. 
Then copy the personal packages template to a file called `personal-packages-testing.xml` so as to be able to use the `.vscode/launch.json` settings.
Adjust the options in `personal-packages-testing.xml` as needed for what you are testing.

Unless you are working on `RepoCheck` code, I would suggest skipping (or disabling) it so you don't get rate limited or a temporary IP ban.

See code formatting from the settings in `.vscode/settings.json`. It's not a big deal if your formatting is slightly different, I'll just correct it afterwards.
